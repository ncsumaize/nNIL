Code and data for calling introgressions, matching introgression blocks to putative founders, and QTL tests for "nested Near-Introgression Lines" in maize.  
These lines were created by crossing recurrent parent line B73 to a set of diverse lines (a subset of founders of the maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population),  
backcrossing 3 times too B73 and then selfing several generations
